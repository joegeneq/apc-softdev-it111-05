Status Report for: Elizondo, Kimberly Mae B. (IT - 111) <br>
Project: AngSalitaNgDiyos?.com Liturgical Site<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Weeks</h1>

The following are arranged in accordance to the scheduled weeks for the fulfillment of the Software Development class.<br>
<hr />

<h2>Week 3: January 26 - January 31</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we must choose the project to work on for the SOFTDEV class. We were given a certain list of possible projects to continue but we should verify first the stability and the willingness of the client to implement the project, in compliance with the requirements of Sir Joe Gene. We were able to trim down the list and come up with at least 3 to 4 viable projects for confirmation.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>Since projects should came from CSPROJ2 classes and must not be your own project, we had a hard time acquiring one because they are either taken already or the client is no longer interested in continuing the project due to hardware limitations or problems with the time table. Also, the cooperation between us and some previous project managers is quite missing because they are not responding to our inquiries. Thus, we experienced some delays in creating the project proposal and must look for more viable projects.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>We must provide backup plans in case unfavourable responses are obtained. We must also think of all the possible ways to convince the project owners / clients that their projects are in good hands.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>Should continue asking for confirmation / responses from the project owners. In case one of them send their confirmation, a meeting with the client should be performed.</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Week 4: January 26 - January 31</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we decided to pursue the AngSalitaNgDiyos.com Liturgical Site, provided that it is open for continuation and improvements and is available for grab. Since the project is handled by Mr. Ernesto Boydon, we decided to consider him as our project adviser, together with Ms. Ma. Theresa Montemayor.  Also, we were able to gather enough details regarding the project.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>We had difficulties in gathering data at first, resulting to delays in providing information for the SOFTDEV and other class’ wiki page. Also, since Mr. Boydon is not around, we weren.t able to ask him some questions regarding the project. Contacting the possible panelists also became an issue here due to our contrasting schedule.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>Filling up the wiki pages with project information must be started immediately and must inform the possible panelist about the project details and their roles.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>Gathering of more project details must be performed, in coordination with Mr. Boydon. Project confirmation must be received from the SOFTDEV professor. Identifying user requirements must be achieved before starting the project’s design and development phase. A step that enables us to create a definite time table must also be considered.</blockquote>

<h2>Week 5: February 9 - February 14</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we started doing the initial documentation part of the project. An initial database prototype was developed, in line with the requirements for our Quality class. Also, project details such as vision, scope and other related documents were finalized to have a clearer perspective of the project’s scale. A meeting with Sir Boogie Boydon was also held to have some verifications. We are actually starting the development phase of the project and slowly adapting to the yii framework environment.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>Since the chosen project is not a previous PBL requirement, we actually had difficulties in acquiring existing information regarding the project. Also, the database of the project was not given due to the fact that maybe a new database is needed to be created. Thus, we have to start from scratch.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>We need to consult our database adviser, Ms. Tess, for constant consultation meetings. Also, we have to hear her comments and recommendations for the ERD and other database related files so that we can provide an accurate database design for the project. We must also update our project adviser regarding the progress of the project and for some clarifications and recommendations. We should also establish a well-defined documentation so that further queries will be answered.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>For next week, we must verify the ERD and database design with our database adviser. We should also start coding the project and finalize all the details included in the database. A continuous practice in the yii environment should also be done so that further problems and difficulties can be avoided.</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Week 6: February 16 - February 21</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we continued practicing Yii 2.0 framework. Also, we started finalizing the information we need in our database. We created an excel file that will consolidate all the data that will be included in the calendar.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>We scheduled a consultation meeting with Ms. Tess last Wednesday but unfortunately, she had important commitments outside school. Some application shortcomings also occurred maybe due to large files placed inside my folder on the repository.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>Since we weren’t able to have our database consultations, we decided to just email the initial database design to our advisers for initial review and for preparation for the next consultation. As for my individual problem, I had the applications reinstalled and reduced unnecessary files.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>For next week, we must make sure that we will be having our consultations with our advisers and continue developing the project. We must also prepare the initial prototype for iteration 0 and partially populate the database with data.</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Week 7: February 23 - February 28</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we focused on practicing Yii 2.0 in preparation for the midterms hands-on test. Also, we agreed to do some revisions on the database design in line with suggestions of our database adviser.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>We had problems in applying some database revisions because we got confused on the relationships of some tables and which attributes should be included in each entities.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>Our database adviser is helping us thoroughly with the revisions and it’s a big help in understanding the database design clearly. We’re also looking forward to come up with the final database design so that we can fully focus on the development phase of the project.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>For next week, we must make sure that we already have the final database and must focus more on the development phase of the project. Also, we should track the progress of the project if it’s still in line with the time table we set.</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Week 8: March 2 – March 8</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we continued developing the project. Also, we did some revisions again in the final database which needed some clarifications. We also discussed the necessary things for project’s iteration 1.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>We had problems in the database again and we weren’t able to populate it because of some unnecessary foreign keys existing in the tables.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>We had our consultation with our project advisers and hopefully, we can come up with a plan in line with the upcoming iteration 1.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>For next week, we must make sure that we already have an initial project to be presented in the client. It doesn’t need to be very excellent already so that we can still have improvements to work on for the next iterations. Also, the final database is still the priority.</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Week 9: March 9 – March 14</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>
<blockquote>This week, we conducted the first project iteration. We were able to come up with an initial prototype to be presented to the client. Also, we finalized the database that we will be using throughout the project development phase. We started entering data necessary for the calendar module of the project.</blockquote>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>
<blockquote>One of the problems we encountered is the speed of the system. We added initial values in the database and then tried to pull it out and display it in the calendar. We thought that if we add more values in the database, the system will be slower than the usual.</blockquote>

<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>
<blockquote>We decided to run the system in different laptop to prove if the assumption we made is right. We assumed that the reason why it is slow is that the localhost server we are using is fully loaded. But, we still have to try running the system in the host server.</blockquote>

<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>
<blockquote>For next week, we should implement the changes recommended by the client and continue the development phase of the project. Also, we have to finish feeding the database with information necessary for the project.<br>
