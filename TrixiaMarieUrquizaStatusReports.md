## Week 3: January 26 - January 31 ##

### A. Tasks Accomplished ###

We are still currently looking for a project to continue for SOFTDEV. This week we are able to find a list of possible projects that we could use. We communicate with the previous owners of the projects that we listed.

### B. Problems encountered ###

Most of the projects listed in wiki are already taken and/or some of the clients are not willing to continue the project implementation. Also, the previous owners of the projects that we aimed to continue developing are not willing to communicate and to provide us information because they think they might use the project for their future subjects.

### C. Possible solutions ###

We must come up with other list of alternative projects that we could use for SOFTDEV and communicate with other connections that we have.

### D. Next steps to accomplish ###

Continue looking for a project that the client are willing to pursue the project. Another thing that we must accomplish is to continuously communicate with the clients that are willing to continue the project.

## Week 4: February 2 - February 7 ##

### A. Tasks Accomplished ###

This week we already settled with the project that we are going to use for SOFTDEV. We agreed to take -AngSalitaNgDiyos.com Liturgical Site- and we already have our project advisers.

### B. Problems encountered ###
We had difficulties in acquiring all the information and files that we need in order to provide details for our wiki pages and to start conducting necessary plans for doing the development phase. We also had conflicts of schedule with our chosen panellist and we're still about to confirm their availability and response.

### C. Possible solutions ###
Continue communicating with the client and to our advisers on what are the things that we must accomplish and also provide a timeline where we should meet the expected deliverables in order to get the project done on time. We must also communicate with our selected panellist via email or if permitted by time we could talk to them personally.


### D. Next steps to accomplish ###

We must have a set of panellist and also we must acquire all the information that we need from the client to finish doing part of our documentation and we must start doing all the things necessary for analysing and design phase so we could have a smooth development phase.

## Week 5: February 9 - February 14 ##

### A. Tasks Accomplished ###
This we we already come up with the initial project plan and settled various aspects of the project such as the scope, vision of the project and an initial database design. We also had our first meeting with our project advisers regarding the database design that we should come up and we also verify the scope and other specifications that the client wants about the project.

### B. Problems encountered ###
Since the project that we chose is not part of the previous PBL projects, we are having a hard time when it comes to the documentation part of the project. We don't have any previous documents to rely on and part of our time will be filling out our own documentation of the project specifically the database design.

### C. Possible solutions ###
We should study how we can come up with the right logic that would fit to the requirements of the project and then come up with the database design patterned to the logic that we have. We should fully understand what should be the output of our project and in order to do that we have to regularly conduct meetings with our adviser.

### D. Next steps to accomplish ###
Review initial project plan, specially the database design. Have a consultation with Ms. Tess regarding the ERD design and continuously communicate with Sir Boogie and the clients with the updates of the project. The whole project team must come up with the list of all the events for the calendar. The team should also continuously learn using the yii framework and further research on its functions that might be used in creating the project.

## Week 5: February 16 - February 21 ##

### A. Tasks Accomplished ###
This week we have been starting to encode all the events that are listed on the website that Sir Boogie sent us via e-mail for reference. We were also able to create our Sql file from the ERD that we have come up for our database design.We are also practising how to navigate and use the Yii framework with the help of the activities and exercises that we are doing in the class.

### B. Problems encountered ###
In line with the clarifications that we need with our Adviser for Database design and management, we are having problems with the sudden change of schedules because she has some important matters to attend to and with that our meeting which supposedly, for confirmations with regards to our ERD was postponed. We are also having conflicts with how we can use the extensions of Yii and apply it in line with our project.

### C. Possible solutions ###

We have to find another schedule for our meeting with our Adviser and list all the possible questions that we might ask so that the flow of conversation is smooth and we can gather all the necessary information that we need to move forward in the development of our project. We should also search more about the extensions that the Yii framework offers and utilize them so it can make our development easier.

### D. Next steps to accomplish ###

We have to finalize our ERD, create a database, apply it to the Yii framework and move forward with the development phase. We have to look for other references that might help us in developing our project. Also , we have to continue learning the Yii framework
