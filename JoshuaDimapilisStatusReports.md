# Introduction #

Status Report for: **Dimapilis, Joshua C.** (IT - 111) <br>

Project: <i>AngSalitaNgDiyos.com</i> Liturgical Site<br>
<br>
<h1>Weeks</h1>

The following are arranged in accordance to the scheduled weeks for the fulfillment of the Software Development class.<br>
<br>
<hr />

<h2>Week 3: January 26 - January 31</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>

Currently, we are in the project selection phase. This week, we were able to come up with a <i>list of prospect projects</i> to be continued for SOFTDEV. From the list we derived, we are to select a project based on the responses from previous project owners and clients.<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

Most of the previous projects from the first two weeks were either already taken, or had no clients willing to pursue project implementation. In line with this, some of the <i>previous project owners</i> were hesitant to provide information, and to reply to our inquiries because of the fear that they might not be able to use it for their <b>future projects.</b> As a result, most of them no longer replied to our inquiries.<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

We must <b>formulate other alternatives / choices</b> for our SOFTDEV project, as soon as possible. We must <b>establish a better way</b> to contact prospect project owners / clients.<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

Some steps include seeking other project options from another class or from other subjects or professors. Another step that must be accomplished is to continuously follow up with project owners / clients who are <i>responding</i> and are <i>willing.</i>

<hr />

<h2>Week 4: February 2 - February 7</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>

This week, we have ascended from the <i>Project Selction</i> phase to the <i>Project Design and Development</i> phase. We have confirmed the availability of the project <b><i>AngSalitaNgDiyos.com</i> Liturgical Site</b>, and along with this we have selected project mentors/advisers (<i>Mr. Ernesto Boydon</i> and <i>Ms. Ma. Theresa Montemayor</i>) for our SOFTDEV project.<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

With regard to our <i>Project Panelists,</i> we were unable to contact them late this week because of the clash in our schedules.<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

Solutions that must be implemented, include <b>contacting project panelists</b> immediately. Schedule a very brief meeting with the prospect project panelists.<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

The <b>approval</b> from our professor, Sir Joe Gene Quesada must be received for confirmation on the selected project, as discussed in Saturday's SOFTDEV meeting. Continuously <b>communicate</b> with our clients, and <b>coordinate</b> with Sir Ernesto Boydon about further details of the project. Lastly, we must begin identifying the necessary requirements and development steps we must use to <b>fulfill</b> the clients' requests.<br>
<br>
<hr />

<h2>Week 5: February 9 - February 14</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>

During our fifth week, we have begun the development phase for the tool. A database design version 1 has been created. This <i>database</i>, along with the <b>Entity Relationship Diagram</b> is the initial idea of the team for which will be the foundation of the tool's information storing system. The team has also become accustomed to using the <b>git repository</b> provided to us by our adviser. We have populated the <i>repository</i> with the necessary folders for documentation, preparation and development. The team has started <b>practicing in the yii framework</b>, although the changes the team has applied are very minor, we believe that the team is slowly being oriented to the specified framework for development.<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

Initial interviews with our mentor, informed us that the system did not have previous documentation and database records. Leading us to believe that the existing system (the site currently hosted in AngSalitaNgDiyos.com) was done by an external party, and not by APC. Unfortunately, there are no existing documentation, database designs, and requirements specifications created by the previous developers that are available to us.<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

Our proposed solutions (some of which are already underway) include (1) Preparing our <b>own database design</b> and other relationship diagrams, (2) Clearly making our <b>own documentation</b> for succeeding developers / users / clients, and (3) Continuous <b>consultation</b> with our mentors and adviser about any deliverable and our prepared outputs.<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

For next week, we will be having a consultation with our Database Design and Management adviser, and from this we will be able to derive the validity of the version 1 of our <b>database</b> design and our <b>entity relationship diagram</b>. The team is also to prepare a summary of all the events to be included in the Calendar tool. This will aid the developers of the team to further identify <b>(1)</b> an estimate of the data volume to be used for the database, and <b>(2)</b> a specified timeframe for encoding the mentioned data. Lastly, the team must also prepare and <b>practice</b> the usage of the <b>yii framework</b> for future endeavors involved in the project.<br>
<br>
<hr />

<h2>Week 6: February 16 - February 21</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>

This week, we were able to <b>begin the summary</b> of the events for the Calendar System. We were also able to <b>accomplish producing an SQL file</b> to be used for the Calendar's database. In line with all the exercises and activities for Yii this week, we were able to <b>study and learn more about the framework.</b>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

One of the difficulties we've encountered this week was the sudden conflict in our adviser's schedule. She had an emergency meeting with National University this week, so we were unable to consult with her directly. We also encountered multiple extensions in the internet to be used for the Calendar application, the dilemma is to identify which extension best suits the functions of our Calendar.<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

Some of the solutions we've agreed upon is to provide a new schedule for our consultation. We've also agreed to provide information about our ERD and make the file available for her to view / comment on. We also have to finalize the extension to be used for the system.<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

We've emailed the new schedule to our Mentor, along with the ERD .mwb file for her convenience. We've also agreed to discuss more about the extensions this coming week which should lead to a finalization of the coding extension for the framework. Lastly, this week we must study more about the yii framework for the midterms and our project.<br>
<br>
<hr />

<h2>Week 7: February 23 - February 28</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks Accomplished</h3>

This week, we <b>studied for our midterms</b> and we were able to accomplish the midterm hands on during Saturday. We were also able to re-trace the steps for our <b>database.</b>

<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

Initially, we found it difficult to <b>properly create the versions of our database</b>, because we were already a little bit rusty on our database skills. Luckily, our mentor for Database Design and Management was willing to help us directly.<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

We've incorporated the <b>changes</b> that were advised to us, and we are currently looking forward to her positive response with regard to the <b>finalization</b> of the database to be used.<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

Next week we need to <b>accomplish the finalization of the database</b> and the initial <b>steps towards the success of the Calendar app</b>. <b>Development must be pursued.</b>
