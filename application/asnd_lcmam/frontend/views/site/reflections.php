			<h3 style="text-indent: 20px">
				<b>First Reading: Acts 2:1-11</b>
			</h3>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND/CONTEXT OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
				The Jewish Pentecost was the second most important Jewish feast. Every year, on this day, devout Jews from all around the world gather to celebrate the birth of Israel as God’s chosen people, in the covenant Law given to Moses on Mt. Sinai. Jesus’ disciples gathered, not to celebrate the feast, but to wait for the fulfillment of a promise made by Jesus before He ascended into Heaven.
			</p>
			
			<br>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">MESSAGE/MEANING OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			The timing was very fitting. Christ’s church was born on the feast day of God’s covenant with his chosen people! The birth of the chosen people became the birth of the church, the new people of God. The feast of the Law became the feast of the Spirit.
			<br><br>
			The Holy Spirit, unleashed on Jesus’ disciples, transformed a timid and anxious group into bold and powerful witnesses for Christ. From a confused and scattered lot, they were united into a community characterized by brotherly love and filled with a deep sense of mission. The same Spirit is the origin of all the great movements in the Church, transforming and renewing it in every generation.
			<br><br>
			We, too, receive the Holy Spirit in the sacraments - quietly, but just as powerfully. The Holy Spirit, who is completely and truly God now dwells within us, transforming us to become like Christ, transforming us to be God’s pride and joy. But to feel the transforming effect of the Holy Spirit in our lives, our cooperation is indispensable. We have to listen to the promptings of the Spirit and be open to Him. Mary Most Holy and all the saints are eloquent proofs of the transforming power of the Holy Spirit.

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">HOW TO PROCLAIM</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			Beginning with the words, “And suddenly,” build momentum in your proclamation through the words, “as the spirit enabled. . .”, by progressively increasing the energy in your voice as you are telling of this dramatic event. Pause before the words, “Now there were devout Jew. . .” Lower the tone of your voice and resume a narrative tone as you read this sentence. Practice the pronunciation of the words in Word Watch, This reading is both challenging and rewarding because of the concentration of Biblical Words in one sentence. Do not rush through the enumeration; enunciate each name in the list, to further emphasize to the assembly the universal reach of God’s saving work through Christ in the Holy Spirit. Proclaim the concluding line of the reading (“yet we hear them speaking”) without rushing and with marvel and excitement in your voice.

			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			The Psalmist praises God for his wonderful works in creation. When the psalmist talks about the Spirit renewing the earth, he was most probably referring to springtime. For Christians, the renewal of the face of the earth can be viewed as a renewal of creation with the church being its first fruits.

				<b>Second Reading:1 Cor. 12:3b-7, 12-131</b>
			</h3>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND/CONTEXT OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			The church in Corinth, composed of mostly Jewish and Greek converts, faced many issues – internal divisions and questions on faith. Paul writes to the Corinthians to address the problems encountered by the young church.
			</p>
			
			<br>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">HOW TO PROCLAIM</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			Pause briefly between Paul’s expressions of difference and sameness. Look up the assembly and proclaim clearly and solemnly, emphasizing each word of the phrase, “so also Christ”. Emphasize each occurrence of the word,”one” to drive home Paul’s support and encouragement for unity in the Church.

				<b>Gospel: Gospel John 20:19-23</b>
			</h3>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND/CONTEXT OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			After Jesus’ crucifixion, his disciples were afraid for their lives. Their master is dead and they fear that the authorities would be looking for them next.
			</p>
			
			<br>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">MESSAGE/MEANING OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			Jesus’ first words to his disciples were “Peace be with you.” He knew that they were afraid and anxious. The disciples rejoiced and Jesus reiterated his greeting, “Peace be with you”, gave them their mission as He breathed the Holy Spirit in them.  
			<br><br>
			“Peace be with you” is a normal Jewish greeting. But Jesus was not wishing his disciples peace; He was assuring them that they have peace. The disciples were told to continue the mission of Jesus - they are to continue doing what He did. And when Jesus breathed on his disciples the Holy Spirit, he breathed new life into them, as God breathed on the man he formed from clay and gave it life.
			<br><br>
			The power that came with the Holy Spirit was the authority to forgive. For the power of God, his Spirit, is a power for forgiveness, for bringing people back to God. The same mission is given to each of us. We are sent to help other people be reconciled to God, to work with God to build his Kingdom. And each of us has a role in this mission, which is why the Spirit has given us different gifts which we should use for the benefit of the one body of Christ, His Church.

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">REFLECTIONS</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			What are your gifts? For whose benefit do you use your gifts? How can these be used for the benefit of God’s people? What evidence of the Spirit’s working in you can be observed? What fruits of the Spirit can be seen in your life?

			<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold">Solemnity of the Lord's Ascension</h3>
			<h3 style="text-indent: 20px">
				<b>First Reading: Acts 1:1-11</b>
			</h3>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND/CONTEXT OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			After his resurrection, having spent 40 days with his beloved disciples, Jesus ascends to His Father in heaven. Today we read about the intimate moment of separation between friends as Jesus bids his disciples farewell.
			<br><br>
			St. Luke presents to Theophilus, who apparently is an important person, the testimonies of several apostles who have seen Jesus after his Resurrection from the Dead until he ascended to heaven right before their eyes.
			<br><br>
			St. Luke also illustrates the significance of the sacred number "40" as it relates to "purification" : 40 days and nights of the great flood during Noah's time, 40 years of exile in the desert for the Israelites, and the Lord's 40 days and nights again in the desert before he began his three-year public ministry and now, 40 days after his Resurrection, Jesus returns to heaven to prepare his apostles for the coming of the Holy Spirit and the beginning of their individual missions to proclaim the Good News.

			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			The disciples were still at a loss as to the meaning of all that has happened - they still expected the restoration of Israel. They had barely gotten over the shock of Jesus’ death and resurrection and now Jesus is leaving them again. But Jesus consoles them and leaves them with the gift of the Holy Spirit: a gift of understanding, a gift of power so that they can do what He did and even more, and a promise that He will not abandon them. The wonderful mystery of the Ascension is that Jesus had to ascend to heaven so that we can receive the Spirit. Jesus’ physical presence was replaced by a more intimate, more pure and more permanent presence.

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND/CONTEXT OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			The letter of St Paul to the Ephesians was not merely addressed to the Christians of Ephesus but also to the other Christian communities of Hierapolis, Laodicea and Colossus and reveals God's plan for the world.

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">MESSAGE/MEANING OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			Paul prays that we may be enlightened so that we can appreciate what God has done for us and live a life worthy of our calling. And just as we are called to continue Christ’s mission on earth, we are also called to share in the glory of Christ. Today we are hemmed in by suffering and disbelief. Our faith is challenged. But we cling to the hope, even as we are struggling, that there is only one ending to the story - that we will claim our inheritance as God’s children and be with Him forever!
			</p>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">HOW TO PROCLAIM</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			Note the second sentence which contains 11 clauses separated by 13 commas. Read the passage slowly observing the pauses which will allow you to group the thoughts together. This letter was written to the area of Ephesus which was then experiencing "growing pains" as Jewish converts and Gentiles who chose to follow the apostles' teachings were given the chance to belong to Christ's fold. Let the spirit of awe and exultation fill your voice as they exhorted the converts with the great privilege and wealth that have been gifted with through their faith in Jesus Christ.

				<b>Gospel: Matthew 28:16-20</b>
			</h3>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND/CONTEXT OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			A few verses before today’s reading, Jesus warned his listeners about false prophets who draw attention to themselves with their pious practices. The Great Commission, the Gospel reading for today, takes place on a mountain during Jesus’ final appearance. Matthew places this scene in Galilee while Luke in Acts relates that Jesus’ appearance was in Jerusalem. The emphasis should not be on where Jesus appeared but on what Jesus had to say before he ascended to Heaven.</p>
			
			<br>

			<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 20px; font-weight: bold">MESSAGE/MEANING OF THE READING</h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
			Jesus initially declares his authority from the Father. And then he gives his disciples his mission, as he passes his own authority to them.
			<br><br>
			The Ascension portrays a different kind of faith. This time, God entrusts man with the mission of working for the coming of God’s Kingdom. God knew that man, filled with His Spirit, will rise to the occasion and courageously carry out the commission.
			<br><br>
			Two thousand years after, we have the same duty to proclaim the Good News, in words and deeds. By the power of the Hoy Spirit, we are to continue the work of Jesus: teaching, healing, spreading love and forgiveness, promoting justice, and caring for the poor.
