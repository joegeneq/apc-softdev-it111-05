	My dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

	<br><br>
	God speaks to us in time and history. God communicates through time and history. From a faith perspective, we can say that history owes its existence to God whose voice is at the origin of human history. Through the revelation of God, human history becomes salvation history. Using the eyes of faith, we are able to discern the dynamic presence of divine action, intervention or communication in our personal and communal histories. The peak of God’s intervention is in Jesus Christ, the Word of God made flesh, and by doing so, was immersed in the drama of human history. Revelation is not a mere communication of the content of God’s identity and plan but effects in history what God intends.
	Our people come to church with the expectation of being guided in discovering the meaning of life in the light of faith. They bring their frustrations, needs, sins, wounds and dying to us that the power of the Paschal Mystery may kindle hope and strength for the journey.
	We hope that in our ministry of proclaiming God’s Word, they may hear the word that the Lord has put in every prophet’s mouth. Then somehow, the joyful and painful experiences begin to speak of a God who faithfully walks with them.
